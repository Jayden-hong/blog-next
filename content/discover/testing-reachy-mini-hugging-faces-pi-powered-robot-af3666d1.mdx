Testing Reachy Mini - Hugging Face's Pi powered robotFeb 13, 2026When I saw Jensen Huang introduce the Reachy Mini at CES, I thought it was a gimmick. His keynote showed this little robot responding to human input, turning its head to look at a TODO list on the wall, sending emails, and turning drawings into architectural renderings with motion.HuggingFace and Pollen robotics sent me a Reachy Mini to test, and, well, at least if you're looking to replicate that setup in the keynote, it's not, as Jensen put it, "utterly trivial now."On the promise of that keynote, I accepted a review unit, and promptly put it together, with some assistance from my kids. The older kids were interested throughout, but my youngest (1-year-old) was more interested in slamming various parts into the table to make loud sounds, so he had to sit out most of the build.I decided to open up the Conversation App (which connects Reachy Mini to Open AI for real-time interactive chat), and see what would happen if I let my kids start talking.What happened next alarmed me.Within seconds of starting the conversation app, my daughter told the robot her name.

Before the first couple minutes were up, she started providing the names of her siblings and pointing them out so Reachy could aim the camera around and learn who 'he' was talking to.(The kids quickly anthropomorphised Reachy Mini...). Your browser does not support the video tag.It was not going well, so I quickly stopped the app, under the fear my kids would provide Sam Altman's privacy-invading company with even more data on my family than it has already scraped from every posting ever made on the Internet.I explained how they should treat robots and conversational AI as they would a stranger, and not be so forthcoming.When I turned on the app again, they quickly set out to confuse the bot about who was talking to it. Better, but I'd still give my kids at most a few minutes into a future robot apocalypse before they, too, would turn into human batteries.This blog post is a companion to today's video on my YouTube channel, which you can watch below:Reachy Mini WirelessFor the privacy-conscious, Reachy Mini does not require OpenAI. In fact, the $449 Wireless version I'm testing runs off a Raspberry Pi CM4, so you could flash your own OS and controls to it if you want (or modify any of the reachy-mini source).The intention isn't to replace human interaction, rather it's to inspire learning.To help with the safety aspects, at least physically, Reachy Mini is small and somewhat weak. It shouldn't be able to cause physical harm like Blinky™ could.The first time I set up Reachy Mini at home, I did have some trouble—eventually I diagnosed the problem as an IPv6 DNS resolution error.I do have concerns about the 'open by default' nature of the little robot's APIs and web UI, and especially over apps like the conversation app immediately connecting to OpenAI servers without any form of consent. It could quickly become an attack vector i
